# DocuMeds

An app to help make taking medication safer, more effective & anxiety-free.

Currently focused on two things:

1) Scraping medication data from a variety of sources around the internet, data mining to build structure and  relationships between the data and publishing the content with JSON APIs. 

2) A backbone.js client for keeping track of the medication and supplements you are taking

Built with:

- Clojure
- Noir
- Redis
- Aleph
- Enlive
- Backbone.js

## Usage

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```

Also run Redis on localhost, default port with no password.

## License

Developing in the open until full public launch later in the year.
